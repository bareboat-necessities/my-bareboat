== What is BBN Boat Monitoring

BBN Boat Monitoring is a low-power solution to send alarms on various conditions from an unattended boat.

In the center is esp32 with Ethernet module connected wired to a boat router.
Alarms are sent via WhatsApp messenger.

Modular design of software and hardware so users can pick and choose needed modules.

== Connectivity

. MDNS discovery of other services gpsd, SignalK, pypilot, etc

. DHCP client

. NTP client

. Web server for configuration

. Uptime reporting (sleeping periods to save power)

. Ethernet to router

. WhatsApp message

. Command line WhatsApp messenger for Linux

. Internet connection speed reporting

== Hardware

esp32 on m5atom-lite or m5atom-lite-S3. With ethernet atomPoW (with w5500 chip).

Sensors (pick and choose)

* Accelerometer

* IMU

* Env sensors (temperature, barometer, humidity)

* Gas Sensors (CO, heavy gases, hydrogen, smoke detector)

* GPS

* NMEA 0183 interface

* NMEA 2000 interface

* Lightning sensor

* Voltage sensor

* Current (amp) meter for bilge pump usage

* Temperature (1w) sensors

* Motion detection sensors

* Water salinity sensor

* Proximity sensors

* Snow / ice sensor

* Water level sensor

* Dighy LoRa locator

* RTC clock


== Alarms (planned)

. Heavy gases in bilge

. High salinity of water in bilge

. Hydrogen gas alarm

. Fire alarm. Smoke detector

. Carbon monoxide alarm

. Hatch open

. High heel or pitch (from IMU)

. High wind alarm

. Lightning storm detected

. Forgot nav lights 'on'

. Motion detected (Intrusion)

. High humidity

. Possible fog conditions

. Snow or ice conditions

. Barometer keeps falling alarm

. Temp alarm (ex: fridge warm)

. Dingy too far

. GPX fix lost

. High current at anchor (by speed through water)

. Low water under keel alarm

. Accelerometer alarm for high waves

. Anchor alarm (plus command line utility to activate and deactivate)

. Grounding alarm from accelerometer

. Hard impact on hull (via accelerometer)

. Heartbeat (ImAlive) WhatsApp message

. Low battery voltage

. Battery overcharging

. High battery temperature

. Bilge pump high utilization
