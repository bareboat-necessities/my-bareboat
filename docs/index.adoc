== Boat Electronics Project

This document describes a DIY project of building a marine computer, a boat LTE/WiFi gateway, and
a cockpit chartplotter display from easily obtainable and affordable components.
This boat electronics project includes:

* Waterproof marine touch screen HDMI display
* GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, Galileo) receiver
* Sensors for orientation (gyroscope, accelerometer, compass via IMU)
* AIS radar
* Environment temperature, barometric pressure, humidity sensors
* Connections to the boat instruments such as wind, depth, speed, AIS via NMEA 0183 serial ports
* Boat LTE / 4G Gateway, network storage
* Boat WiFi hotspot and a router with WiFi extender and a long range waterproof WiFi antenna
* Optional autopilot integration, rudder angle sensor
* Other NMEA devices, engine/battery status, bilge pump monitoring, etc
* Optional air mouse with a wireless keyboard, and a touchpad
* Lightning EMI sensor and alarm
* RTL-SDR for weather fax, NavTex, satellite weather, AIS, RTL 433, morse code decoder, etc
* Boat IoT Integration via MQTT
* Music Player
* Can be used with Iridium Satellite Modems
* Can be used for processing transmissions received from SSB radio via audio interface
* Variety of options of using wireless handheld devices such as smart phones and tablets
to connect to boat systems via WiFi and bluetooth. There are many marine applications available for
smart phones and tablets.

The boat computer is connected to the waterproof HDMI touchscreen in the cockpit.

NOTE: Keep in mind that by following this document you are building devices to be used in marine environment.
All connections and wiring need to follow marine standards which are more strict than automotive. All nuts and bolts
need to be properly tightened. I've run into issues in my sailboat experience on water just because of
one missing washer (it was in mechanical system on gear switch wire). Heat shrink tubing, wire grades are different
for marine standards. Corrosion in misty salt water air is much higher than on the ground. Conformant coating
is recommended for PCBs. Marine dielectric grease extends the lifetime and the quality of connectors.
A boat is exposed to the elements more than house or automobile appliances.
If you doubt you did something right you better of revisiting it or seeking peer review from other sailors.
The same works the other way. If you see something wrong here with the design let us know :)
There is issues reporting system in GitHub:
https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat/issues

NOTE: Although this document describes mostly instructions on building hardware components, it is designed in
the spirit of open source development. We hope this design is going to evolve and have numerous releases and corrections
if it gains some community. Some software components might become part of this project too. Cost cutting is another sport and
sub-hobby in recreational sailing and boating. So if same functionality can be built cheaper it probably should be, and
here is the reason to change this document.

=== Boat Computer

The boat computer runs on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian Linux) with OpenPlotter 2.0 installed. The boat computer will reside
below deck so it's not going to be waterproof. The touchscreen display runs OpenPlotter UI with OpenCPN chartplotter
and dashboards as well as general Linux UI.

*The boat computer front panel interfaces:*

* 1 USB 3.0 data port
* 1 AUX audio port
* 1 USB 2.0 data port
* 1 HDMI port
* Computer Voltage Meter
* Amp and Voltage Meter Combined
* Status indicators via fiber-optic light pipes
* Fuse box panel mount
* On/Off power switch
* On/Off power switch for cockpit instruments

{zwsp} +

.Boat Computer, Front Panel
image::front-panel-intf.jpg[alt="Boat Computer, Front Panel", width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

*The boat computer back panel interfaces:*

* 1 Ethernet port 1Gbit (for the WiFi router)
* 1 USB 2.0 port for GPS (or something else)
* 1 NMEA-0183 port (More can be added in the same DIY fashion)
* DC power 2-wire input cord mounted inside a waterproof gland for 12v boat connection. SAE-type connector
* DC power 2-wire output cord mounted inside a waterproof gland for 12v cockpit connection. SAE-type connector
(black male)
* HDMI and USB 3.0 connectors to the cockpit display and touchscreen
* RF connector for AIS antenna
* RF connector for RTL-SDR antenna
* SMA RF connector for a secondary GPS

.Boat Computer, Back Panel
image::back-panel-intf.jpg[alt="Boat Computer, Back Panel", width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

*Boat Computer Inside*

NOTE: Raspberry Pi lays on top of the middle divider made out of plastic sheet. The power supply (12v to 5v step-down
converter) is mounted from the other side under the middle divider. The USB hub doesn't fit by height to simply lay
on the divider, so there is a little shelf made out of the same plastic sheet and it is attached by 4 shortest
standoffs. USB hub is mounted under a slight angle to give space to a screw which closes the enclosure.


.Boat Computer, Inside
image::computer-internals.jpg[alt="Boat Computer, Inside", width="75%", pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

On the picture above 7-Port powered USB 3.0 hub, dAISy AIS, Raspberry Pi 4 with a cooling fan and heat sinks,
serial-to-USB stick (with the chipset from FTDI), SSD, RTL-SDR RF stick. 12v to 5v step-down converter is
located below this layer inside the housing box and is connected to the front panel via a fuse and
a switch on the front panel.

You can customize the front and back panels for your needs.

==== Basic Schematics

.Boat Computer Basic Schematics Diagram
image::boat-computer.svg[alt="Boat Computer Basic Schematics Diagram"]

{zwsp} +

Raspberry Pi 4 has also WiFi and BlueTooth interfaces:

* 802.11ac/n
* Bluetooth 5.0

WiFi can be used to set up access to the boat computer from smart phones and tablets
with additional software.

===== NMEA Pinout and Color Coding

.NMEA Wiring Colors

NMEA Pins:

[cols="1,4,2", width="30%"]

image::nmea-pins.jpg[alt="NMEA Pins 1-2-3-4-5. 1 is left, 5 is right", width="50%", pdfwidth="50vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

When wiring NMEA 0183 devices:

 Transmit (Tx) (+) should connect to a receive (Rx) (+)
 Tx (-) should connect to a Rx (-)
 Rx (+) should connect to a Tx (+)
 Rx (-) should connect to a Tx (-)

. In the event the sending device has a Tx (-), but there is not a corresponding Rx (-) on the receiving device,
leave the sending device's Tx (-) disconnected. Failure to follow this guideline can damage the sending device.

. In the event that the receiving device has a Rx (-), but there is no corresponding Tx (-) on the sending device,
bring the Rx (-) to ground.

===== Assembly Activities

Make sure you use correct tools for:

* Measuring
* Cutting
* Clamping
* Drilling
* Heat Shrinking
* Tying
* Crimping
* Screwing

===== Tools

 Drill, Screwdriver, Drill bits, Large hole drill bit, Cutting knife, Caliper,

===== Other Things to Consider (Add-ons)

NOTE: What could I have done better? I think I could use one of the power boards
like 'DockerPi power board' with momentary switch for safe shutdown. Or even
couple Geekworm X828 SATA board (made by SupTronics Technologies) with their
X710 power board. With those I wouldn't need internal USB hub and 12vDC to 5vDC
internal step down converter.

See:

https://geekworm.com/collections/raspberry-pi-4/products/raspberry-pi-x710-power-management-with-wide-voltage-input-6v-to-36v-safe-shutdown-expansion-board

https://geekworm.com/collections/raspberry-pi-4/products/raspberry-pi-x828-stackable-2-5-sata-hdd-ssd-shield


NOTE: (Update: Jan 2020) There is even better board came out. SupTronics X180. 7-Port USB 3.0 self powered hub shield
for raspberry pi 4. So I'd use x710 and x180 combo.

http://www.suptronics.com/miniPCkits/x180.html

NOTE: (Update: Apr 2020)  Strato Pi SPBC12X board (https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/strato-pi-can-board/)

Strato Pi SPBC12X board:

* 9-65Vdc power supply, with surge and reverse polarity protection
* Controller Area Network (CAN) V2.0B interface, supports speeds up to 1Mb/s, with *opto-isolator* and
electrostatic discharge protection
* standard RS-485 interfaces to the Raspberry Pi serial line, with opto-isolator and
electrostatic discharge protection
* real time clock with replaceable CR1025 back-up battery

($140.00)
https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/?qs=PqoDHHvF64%252BAaGJtJ2H51A%3D%3D

or same without CAN-bus, model SPBB30X ($100.00):

https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/strato-pi-base-board/

Google for "industrial raspberry pi" to get more ideas.

Saving it as a template in OpenCPN was a bit tricky on 7" screen as OpenCPN window is too big to see 'OK' button.
I had to press Ctrl-Tab twice followed by Enter, doing it basically blindly.

===== Power Usage

* Preliminary tests show that combined power consumption of Raspberry Pi 4 based boat computer and
Argonaut M7 gen2 7-inch touch display stays under 10 watts.
If I turn off the display then wattage drops to 4-4.5 watts. If I reduce the brightness on the display backlight
it drops dramatically as well. So both display and Pi contribute about the same share in power consumption.
On average I see their combined draw of 0.75 amps at 12v (about 9 watts). This is with 2 chained USB hubs
and long wires (HDMI/USB/power) between a computer and cockpit display and hub, AIS (dAISy), RTL-SDR (plugged in but
idling), Flashdrive SSD, FTDI (connected only into USB).
* 10 watts on 80 amp-hours 12v battery (in my understanding they are rated for that before drop below 10v,
so it is all usable amps) will give you approximately 80*12/10=96 hours of chartplotting at max brightness. C'est la vie.
That's why you need solar panels on your sailboat.
* While experimenting with power usage and connecting/disconnecting various USB devices and
Argonaut M7 to different USB ports and hubs (USB2, USB3) Argonaut M7 became unresponsive.
Even its own power on/off button didn't work. I had to perform a factory reset of it.
* The reset procedure as per manufacturer requires to hold power button on Argonaut M7 display immediately after
full power off/on cycle. On my boat it's really a two-man job then. There is no power switch in cockpit because
the M7 display has its own and the other switch to power it on is below deck. It seems they didn't think about
single handed sailors when they came up with this reset procedure design.
* Turns out if I turn off 12v supply into cockpit it does turn-off the display but it's LED status light still stays on.
So it still gets some power via USB (not much per amp meter). Apparently this is the default behavior of most self powered
USB hubs to draw from the host when they lose own power supply. There are some hubs which have this behavior configured
by a jumper on their PCB, but the default is to power itself from the host.
* I did test fiber-optic USB data cable leading to the cockpit as well. It does have regular wires for power as well, so
it behaves exactly the same. The cable is much thinner so you can have a smaller hole is your boat in a cockpit deck.
* Reboot doesn't work. It just shuts down Pi. There are many reports that pi4 doesn't reboot with USB self powered hubs
if they are not powered off before the reboot and backfeed power into Pi.
So currently the reboot procedures are shutdown and then power cycle the boat computer.
* I've tried installing rpi-backlight but it seems Argonaut M7 monitor doesn't support software backlight control
(at least it doesn't work under Linux) So the only way to control backlight is via Argonaut's own control on
the side of the monitor.


NOTE: After long testing and research I've found a solution for UBS hub power issues. There are two. The first one
is that the hub in cockpit powers the cockpit via USB hub even if I turn the cockpit 12v switch off. The second one is
that Pi doesn't reboot as it stays powered from the hubs. The simplest way to solve it was to tape
USB +5v pin inside female part of USB type A plugs with the electrical tape (see pic). There are two places because
there are 2 self powered hubs need to be isolated. The procedure is actually makes the whole set up even safer.
You do not want extra circuits running from below deck into the cockpit when cockpit
switch is 'off'. Power savings when you turn cockpit off are impressive. Pi takes less than 0.2 amps @ 12v with no HDMI
video connected (only USB connected sensors and flash drive stick). For the cockpit USB 3.0 hub I got
the shortest USB 3.0 type A male to female cable and put tape in it. And for the computer's hub I've just taped
it inside USB 3.0 type-A male part connecting the hub. This is how it was done:

=== Boat Gateway Box

The second box is a boat LTE/WiFi/IoT gateway device and it is an extension to the boat computer.
In case if you do not need HDMI display you might need only the boat gateway because the boat gateway runs its own KPlex
server under OpenWrt Linux. The boat gateway has M5Stack ESP32 micro-controller and is capable to connect to NMEA
(if you customize if a bit further). The boat gateway is connected to the boat computer via Ethernet.
The boat gateway uses the same type of an enclosure as the boat computer.

Features of the boat gateway box:

* WiFi Gateway (connecting to marina's WiFi and on-shore WiFi hot-spots via a long range WiFi antenna)

* LTE / 4G Gateway (providing a boat with Internet and voice access within the zone of reception
of a cellular network)

* VPN gateway

* Ethernet Hub

* Network Access Storage, Network back-up

* M5Stack ESP32 Controller and 3-Buttons LCD display (panel mounted, numerous optional M2Stack add-ons)

* KPlex server running on router's OpenWrt Linux

* GPS NMEA 0183 talker via KPlex

* IoT gateway with MQTT

* Voltage and Amperage Display to monitor power consumption

* Any other additional sensors and devices can be added via M5Stack. M5Stack is programmable micro-controller without
an operating system but very capable of running complex programs

==== Boat Gateway Front Panel

* Power On/Off Switch

* Router Power On/Off Switch

* Panel Mounted Fuse Box

* Panel Mounted M5Stack LCD Display with 3 Buttons

* USB 2.0 Port connected to M5Stack

* Amp and Volt Meter

===== GL-AR750 Router Modifications

The AR-750 router needs to be modified to add external 2.4GHz antenna. Test U.FL connectors need to be removed
and real ones should be soldered. The existing U.FL connector is used by internal 5G band antenna.
See here:

https://www.arednmesh.org/comment/12706#comment-12706

===== GL-X750 (Spitz) Router Modifications

You get this router with the modem you selected for your region. My modem is Quectel EP06-A.
EP06-A has 3 antenna connectors. One is connected to external LTE antenna connector, another one
is Rx Diversity antenna to external connector and middle one is GPS antenna not connected. You can open up router
by unscrewing two screws under serial number sticker (it's easy to remove and put back after).
I've just put another coax cable to GPS antenna connector and cut a bit of plastic in the case just
enough to put that cable through (SMA side on outside).

.GL-X750 Antenna Mod

{zwsp} +

.GL-X750 Case Mod
image::gl-x750-antenna-mod.jpg[alt="GL-X750 Screws", width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

The modem is controlled via 'AT' commands.

Make sure you connect antennas first before activating SIM card in the network or you might get error like:

 SIM card not registered

APN for AT&T has to be set to "broadband".
Device: /dev/ttyUSB2
Service: LTE/UMTS/GPRS


To enable the GPS you have to use

 AT+QGPS=1

command on /dev/ttyUSB2 and then one can read the nmea sentences on /dev/ttyUSB1.
There are additional commands to configure the GNSS functions, but they’re very limited compared
to “regular GNSS chips”. The details can be found in the Quectel EP06&EG06&EM06 GNSS AT Commands Manual.
(Registration required to download)

The command to reset the modem to factory defaults is

 AT+QPRTPARA=3

The router is running linux. While setting it up you can login into it like this:

 ssh root@192.168.8.1

The password would be the one you set in web UI.

Hmm:
There is even KPlex for OpenWrt. I think this GPS can be fed into OpenPlotter from the router!

https://github.com/caesar/kplex-openwrt

And you can install KPlex on a router (precompiled) from the router itself!

{zwsp} +

.KPlex on OpenWrt Router
image::KPlex-OpenWrt-Router.png[alt="KPlex on OpenWrt Router"]

{zwsp} +

AT command for the GPS needs to be run every time on boot. This needs to be scripted.
Install the program called 'socat'. With it you can send commands to the modem from command line.

[source]
----
 echo "AT+QGPS=1" | socat - /dev/ttyUSB2,crnl
----

[source]
----
vi /etc/kplex.conf
----

Put these lines

[source]
----

[serial]
name=gps
filename=/dev/ttyUSB1
direction=in
baud=9600
strict=no

[tcp]
name=router
mode=server
port=10110
direction=out

----


Add startup script

[source]
----

cat > /etc/init.d/modem-gps-init
#!/bin/sh  /etc/rc.common

START=98

start()
{
     echo "AT+QGPS=1" | socat - /dev/ttyUSB2,crnl
}

^D

chmod 755 /etc/init.d/modem-gps-init

----

Another modification: By default in GL-X750 one Ethernet port is set up as WAN and another is LAN.
You can reassign them both as LAN. It is done in web UI of the router.
One LAN port will go to main boat computer and another lan port you can connect to M5Stack LAN base module.
Or even have a ethernet hub inside if you plan bigger boat LAN (in that case you can leave one port as WAN and
connect the router via hub).

GL-X750 aka Spitz router power supply is 12v (No need for buying step-down converter).

NOTE: If you just need chart plotter capabilities it seems you do not even need raspberry pi. You could just install
KPlex on GL-X750 router make sure the modem you picked when you buy the router has GPS. And then you use
OpenCPN installed on an android tablet connected via WiFi to KPLex. And with this you have LTE internet on your boat
and local private WiFi.

NOTE: FlashDrive Stick inserted into the router USB port is automatically shared on network via samba. You should
mount it using this command from Raspberry Pi:

[source, shell]
------
sudo mount -t cifs //gl-x750/SamsungUSB /media/Share -o user=guest,vers=1.0
------

===== Local WiFi, VNC, etc

Raspberry Pi4 supports only one band in access point (AP) mode. So it is either 2.4GHz or 5GHz but not both.
I've set it up to be on 5G for faster speed. For IoT devices I've enabled 2G band on the router.

On the screen shots below their SSIDs are "boatWiFi-5g" and "boatWiFi-IoT".

In web UI of your OpenWrt router:

. Click internet.
. Add repeater.
. Connect to marina WiFi

The UI should look like this when you set up LTE and port WiFi connections:

===== Boat IoT, MQTT, M5Stack

M5Stack is programmed using Arduino IDE. I've set it up on iMac following these instructions:

https://docs.makerfactory.io/m5stack/core/quickstart/macos/

The basic steps are:

* Install cp210x driver
* Install Arduino IDE
* Register board manager
* Download and install m5stack libraries (m5stack core development kit, m5ez, ezTime)

NMEA Display software for M5Stack https://github.com/andyrbarrow/MQTTNMEADisplay

http://forum.openmarine.net/showthread.php?tid=1819

I've made my own custom version. It doesn't require MQTT. It can connect via TCP to SignalK NMEA stream or to Kplex.
The code for the sketch is located here:

https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat/tree/master/m5-boat-display

Currently it supports GPS and Wind displays. I have an idea how to display more from AIS in future.

.Boat Router LTE Speed
image::boat-router/boat-router-lte-speed.jpg[alt="Boat Router LTE Speed", width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

===== Good

* LTE speed is good even with two little antennas it came with.
* Time to acquire a GPS location fix is very short with external antenna. I do not have exact time but it's under
few minutes even inside the house. Having external GPS antenna made a huge improvement.
* Power usage of the whole gateway box in well under 2 watts. 2 watts is under speed stress test with uploads over LTE.

===== Not so good

* External WiFi antenna (the one from the bill of material) did very little to improve the range. (Again I've tested
it inside the house, without placing the antenna outside). My modification of the connector inside the router and soldering
it might have been not good so you might have better results.
* Bigger LTE antenna (again from the bill of material) didn't give better signal quality (even a bit lower) than
original antennas supplied with Spritz router. (Could be different picture on other bands though). With either of
antennas LTE performed well.


==== Other Ideas

Connect NMEA multiplexer to the router via USB. Here is one affordable NMEA multiplexer:

==== Installation

After completing installation you can see which packages got installed.

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt list --installed | grep opencpn
sudo apt list --installed | grep openplotter
----

To see which available OpenCPN packages are there:

[source,shell]
----
apt-cache search opencpn
----

Install missing ones:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get -y install `apt-cache search opencpn | cut -d ' ' -f1`
----


I also like to add firefox as additional browser in case chromium fails to display some page.

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get -y install firefox-esr
----


==== Initial Settings

[source,shell]
----
sudo rc_gui
----

[.text-center]

You would need to enable SPI, I2C, Serial Port, 1-Wire and Remote GPIO and
disable Serial Console in Raspberry Pi Configuration utility. Set video memory to 512 (MB). See:

.Raspbian Interfaces Settings
image::config/raspbian-settings.png[Raspbian Interfaces Settings, width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

Disable screen blanking. Reboot after changing settings in Raspberry Pi Configuration screen.

In Openplotter Serial you need to enable UART. This will disable Bluetooth. Reboot after it.

Edit /boot/config.txt to add (to enable 64-bit kernel)

[source]
-----
arm_64bit=1
-----

Your /boot/config.txt should look like this (I've stripped the commented lines):

[source]
-----
arm_64bit=1

disable_overscan=1

dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=spi=on
dtparam=audio=on

[pi4]
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
max_framebuffers=2

[all]
gpu_mem=512
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=w1-gpio
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
-----

* arm_64bit=1 is for enabling 64-bit linux kernel.
* gpu_mem=512 reserves 512Mb of memory to the graphic video card.

==== Look & Feel Settings

You want to change all your look and feel settings BEFORE you install OpenCPN (otherwise it will still mix it
with old settings)

===== Dark Theme

[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get -y install breeze-gtk-theme breeze-icon-theme breeze-icon-theme breeze-icon-theme-rcc breeze-cursor-theme
----

Start lxappearance
[source, bash]
----
lxappearance
----

and choose 'Breeze-Dark' widget theme
click 'Color tab'
and set foreground colors to "#808080". This is needed to overcome existing bugs in OpenPlotter and OpenCPN
handling of dark themes (There are reported bugs that in some screens they draw white font on white background).

I use PXFlat for icon, mouse, window border themes.

Back to 'Widget' tab and 'Apply'

For 800x480 resolution 12pt fonts in menus and dialogs are too big. You might not see full content of the forms.
So change it to 11pt in OpenCPN and Desktop Settings.

Change desktop background color to black and text color to white (Right Click on desktop -> Desktop Preferences).

===== Fonts

Default Raspberry OS fonts are not very readable on small displays in cocktpit (especially under sunlight)
Install Ubuntu fonts and switch to using them.

[source, bash]
----
 sudo apt-get -y install fonts-ubuntu
----

===== Multiple Desktops

Start OpenBox config

[source, bash]
----
obconf
----

Click 'Desktops' tab, add new desktop. Create couple desktops, give them names ('One', 'Two').
Click 'Margins' tab, set all margins to 0. Save changes and exit obconf.

Right click on taskbar. Check: 'Icons Only', 'Show windows from all desktops'.

Right click on taskbar. Select 'Add/Remove Panel Items', then 'Panel Applets/Add/Desktop Pager.
Close.

Or:

[source, bash]
----
lxpanelctrl config
----

Add desktop pager to panel


===== Desktop

Desktop is actually configured via file manager preferences.

[source, bash]
----
pcmanfm
----

'Edit'/'Preferences'.
Check 'Don't ask options on launch executable'.

You can copy *.desktop files into ~/Desktop and use them as application launch shortcuts.

Example:
[source, bash]
----
cp /usr/share/applications/opencpn.desktop ~/Desktop/
----


You can use 'wmctrl' command to switch between desktops and start programs on different desktops.

[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get -y install wmctrl
----

Examples:

[source, bash]
----

# Switch to desktop #2
wmctrl -s 1

# Move Chromium to desktop #2
wmctrl -i -r `wmctrl -l | grep Chromium | cut -d ' ' -f1` -t 1

----

===== Menus

You will be installing other software which you do not what to appear mostly under 'Other' menu.
You want more gradual menu structure than default. Install 'extra-xdg-menus'.

[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get -y install extra-xdg-menus
----

lsusb command will output all devices connected to USB bus.

Run

[source, shell]
------
openplotter-serial

=== Geolocation

==== GNSS

BU-353S4 GPS USB mouse by default is using binary SiRF protocol. You need to switch it once to NMEA before first use.

[source, shell]
------
sudo apt-get -y install gpsd-clients
------

Do

[source, shell]
------
lsusb
------

Plug in USB mouse into raspberry pi USB port. Do lsusb again to see which new USB device appeared.
Use that device port in the command below.

[source, shell]
------
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 4800
sudo gpsctl -n /dev/ttyUSB0
------

To obtain a fix GPS receiver needs a clear sky view. You need to have it outside. Chances are it is not going to find
a location from inside your house.

==== Celestial Navigation

OpenCPN has a plugin to calculate a fix from various object sightings.

KStars is a program for the night sky view catalog. Can be installed from official archives using apt.

https://kde.org/applications/education/org.kde.kstars

Stellarium is a free open source planetarium for your computer

https://stellarium.org/

[source, shell]
------
sudo apt-get -y install stellarium
------

Stellarium starts in full screen mode and with my screen resolution the 'Exit'
button is not visible on my touchscreen. You need to go into configuration screen in
Stellarium and disable one more group of buttons in front of 'Exit' button.

'Exit' button is on bottom right.

Also change fonts in settings to size 11 (from 13).

Challenge: It would be interesting to integrate Stellarium for on board IMU to
turn it into augmented reality app. And make a planetarium in the cabin with a projector. :)
Also stars will let you check if your magnetic compass is correct.
You will be able to locate satellites easier and tune your antennas better.

I think it shouldn't be difficult based on this code:

https://github.com/daniel-s-ingram/stellarium-oculus/commit/8b78c323de54a7e35aae61815ba60bcfa25f3492#diff-25d902c24283ab8cfbac54dfa101ad31

==== NTP Time Server Synchronization from GPS

This post describes how to set it up with couple of lines in config files.

https://agile4life.blog/2018/07/16/sailing-with-linux-nmea-gpsd-iridium/

In case if you have OpenWrt boat router then it might be better to set it up on the router.

==== Time Zones at Sea

{zwsp} +

[quote, According to https://data.iana.org, Time Zones at Sea]
A ship within the territorial waters of any nation uses that nation's time. In international waters,
time zone boundaries are meridians 15° apart, except that UT−12 and UT+12 are each 7.5° wide and
are separated by the 180° meridian (not by the International Date Line, which is for land
and territorial waters only). A captain can change ship's clocks any time after entering
a new time zone; midnight changes are common.

===== OpenMap Tiles (Non-marine)

https://openmaptiles.org/

==== Touch Screen

===== Multi-touch emulation with twofing

One of the issues that kept bugging me was the lack of multitouch support on a touchscreen
in OpenCPN and Raspbian UI in general. Well there is a fix! The solution requires the program called 'twofing'.
It is easy to install. I've combined the script for my Argonaut M7 waterproof display.

See: https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat/blob/master/twofing/rpi_twofing_install.sh

[source,shell]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat/master/twofing/rpi_twofing_install.sh
chmod +x rpi_twofing_install.sh
./rpi_twofing_install.sh
reboot
----

Now zooming works with two fingers, there is a right click emulation with two fingers touch as well.
With few modifications it can work for other screens. You will need to find out vendorID, productID and
name for your touch screen display.
I have Argonaut M7 gen2 screen. It gives me VendorID: 0000, ProductId: 0009, Name:
'Argonaut. Touchscreen'.
For Argonaut M7 gen1 I've seen in posts VendorID: 04d8, ProductId: f724
and reported device name as 'Microchip Technology, Inc.'.
For VendorID:ProductId 04D8:F724 these instructions might work: https://chalk-elec.com/?p=2028

Another issue with twofing and Chromium browser is that latest Chromium browser does handle multi touch
fine by itself and twofing interferes with that. To fix that you need to add "chrome" into 'profiles.h'
'blacklist' variable in twofing code. Edit 'profiles.h', recompile it and copy into /usr/bin/ :

[source, shell]
------
rm *.o twofing
make
sudo cp twofing /usr/bin/
------

===== Right click emulation with long touch

NOTE: After using it underway during two-week cruise I noticed that more important than two finger zoom is
the ability to perform right click. I've added the script which will turn on emulation of right click with a long touch.
This way you can add way points in OpenCPN and do other actions which require a right mouse click. (Ex: access to
the context menu). The program is called evdev-rce.

[source,shell]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat/master/right-click-emu/right-click-emu.sh
chmod +x right-click-emu.sh
./right-click-emu.sh
reboot
----

===== On-screen keyboard

One more issue is entering the text on a touchscreen. I've added virtual on screen keyboard. I've compared
several ones, and the one I liked the most is onboard https://github.com/linuxmint/onboard

I've made a script to install it.
See:
https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat/blob/master/onboard-rpi/onboard-install-rpi.sh

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get -y install dbus-x11 onboard
----

With 'twofing' fix and an on-screen 'onboard' keyboard OpenCPN is much more usable on my touch screen display.
Smooth Panning/Zooming, OpenGL, and Touchscreen should be all enabled in OpenCPN settings.

The sound didn't work out of aux port. By default Raspberry Buster uses HDMI audio output and Argonaut M7 doesn't
have a speaker. This command switches it to aux (You will need to add it into linux startup scripts if you
want it on every boot):

[source, shell]
-----
amixer cset numid=3 1
-----

==== OpenCPN Plugins

There are many plugins which you should install for OpenCPN.
The script to install them is here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat/master/addons/opencpn-plugins-install.sh

There are two dashboard plugins with overlapping functionality.
One is Dashboard Plugin and another one is Dashboard Tactics Plugin. It seems
Dashboard Tactics Plugin is going to be a better choice for long term.

OpenCPN plugin for AIS radar was missing from the repositories. Here is the way to install it:

[source, shell]
----
wget https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/dan-dickey/opencpn-raspbian-unstable/deb/raspbian/pool/buster/main/a/ai/aisradar_pi_1.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i aisradar_pi_1.1-1_armhf.deb
----

==== Building OpenCPN from source

[source, shell]
----
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential cmake gettext git-core gpsd gpsd-clients libgps-dev wx-common libwxgtk3.0-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgtk2.0-dev wx3.0-headers libbz2-dev libtinyxml-dev libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat1-dev libcairo2-dev libarchive-dev liblzma-dev libexif-dev libelf-dev libsqlite3-dev bc bison flex libssl-dev python3 ddd htop

git clone https://github.com/opencpn/opencpn.git

cd opencpn && mkdir build && cd build

cmake -DOCPN_BUNDLE_TCDATA=ON -DOCPN_BUNDLE_GSHHS=CRUDE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DOCPN_USE_CRASHREPORT=OFF -DOCPN_ENABLE_PORTAUDIO=OFF -DOCPN_ENABLE_SYSTEM_CMD_SOUND=ON -DOCPN_FORCE_GTK3=OFF ..

=== Compass / IMU / Barometer / Thermometer

Launch

[source, shell]
-----
openplotter-i2c
-----

and create sensors and connections as per screenshots below:

.Openplotter I2C Sensors
image::config/openplotter-i2c-sensors.png[Openplotter I2C Sensors, width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

.Openplotter I2C Connections
image::config/openplotter-i2c-connections.png[Openplotter I2C Connections, width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

To add compass you need to launch

[source, shell]
-----
openplotter-pypilot
-----

Create a connection like that:

.Openplotter PyPilot Connections
image::config/openplotter-pypilot-connections.png[Openplotter PyPilot Connections, width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

Check your set up

[source, shell]
-----
openplotter-startup check
-----

==== SignalK Connections

. Set up SignalK to Sync up time with GPS.
. Set up SignalK to translate data into NMEA0183
. The created connections should look like this:

.SignalK Connections
image::boat-network/signalk-connections.png[SignalK Connections, width="75%",  pdfwidth="75vw", align="center"]

{zwsp} +


==== Calibration

IMU needs to be calibrated.

See: https://openplotter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pypilot/calibration.html

In case you run into issues doing it you can start

[source, shell]
-----
pypilot_boatimu
-----

and check for errors.


=== Troubleshooting

Run

[source, shell]
-----
telnet localhost 10110
-----

to see NMEA data from SignalK. This is the stream you would need to set up as a connection in
OpenCPN.

Press Ctrl-] to get to telnet prompt anf type 'quit' and hit 'Enter' to exit from telnet session.

Sample output:

[source]
-----

-----

NOTE: You would need to calibrate your IMU sensors on your boat after mounting the computer inside the boat.
Unfortunately OpenPlotter calibration dialogs are a bit big for the resolution of your cockpit monitor.
So for calibration you might need to bring a higher resolution HDMI screen.

NOTE: When complicated issues arise (if you think it is hardware related) try to find out a chipset of the device in question and start
googling the chipset and the symptoms. Usually it gives better results than just searching by the vendor/model.

=== SDR

==== Install Command line RTL_SDR with direct sample mode support

[source, shell]
-----
sudo apt-get -y install cmake libusb-1.0.0-dev build-essential
git clone https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat
cd my-bareboat/rtl-sdr/ && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
make && sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
sudo cp ../rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
/usr/local/bin/rtl_sdr
-----

You should see an option to enable direct sample mode

[source]
-----
rtl_sdr, an I/Q recorder for RTL2832 based DVB-T receivers

Usage: -f frequency_to_tune_to [Hz]
[-s samplerate (default: 2048000 Hz)]
[-d device_index (default: 0)]
[-g gain (default: 0 for auto)]
[-p ppm_error (default: 0)]
[-b output_block_size (default: 16 * 16384)]
[-n number of samples to read (default: 0, infinite)]
[-S force sync output (default: async)]
[-D direct_sampling_mode, 0 (default/off), 1 (I), 2 (Q), 3 (no-mod)]
[-N no dithering (default: use dithering)]
filename (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)
-----

Blacklist interfering Linux RTL drivers

[source]
-----
sudo bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/modprobe.d/no-rtl.conf
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
blacklist rtl2832
blacklist rtl2830
EOF'
-----

reboot

==== Command Line

Command line receiver and demodulator:

http://kmkeen.com/rtl-demod-guide/

Example:
The following command will play FM 104.3 MHz Station on your speaker:

[source, shell]
-----
rtl_fm -M wbfm -f 104.3M | play -r 32k -t raw -e s -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -
-----

==== MultimonNG decoders

https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng

[source, shell]
-----
sudo apt-get -y install multimon-ng netcat
-----

==== Meta Packages for SDR and HAM radio

Because there are so many separate packages for SDR and HAM radio software someone
made a set of meta-packages which install bundles of packages for different aspects of radio interests.

Names start with hamradio-*

Example:

[source, shell]
-----
sudo apt-get -y install hamradio-sdr
-----

==== GQRX
Install SDR receiver app called GQRX

https://gqrx.dk/

[source, shell]
-----
sudo apt-get -y install rtl-sdr rtl-ais gqrx-sdr
-----



Easiest way to try your RTL-SDR dongle is via tuning to FM station.

. Launch GQRX
. Set up input SDR dongle and audio output
. Tune to a FM station (Example 104.3 MHz in my area) (see screen shot)
. Adjust gain in audio control. You should hear clear radio.

=== AIS

Setting up dAISy AIS is very straight forward. It does require higher baud rate, so make sure you specify it correctly.
After plugging into USB and antenna and registering in openplotter-serial in device mapping and connections it should
start giving AIS targets sentences via NMEA. If it doesn't see any ships close by then it doesn't send any sentences.

There are multiple ways to receive weather predictions:

* Download GRIB files via internet. (Only works if internet is available). You have this functionality
as a part of GRIB OpenCPN plugin.

* GRIB files via SSB radio (out of scope here)

* Weather FAX (some people just connect radio to computer audio input, record audio file and covert it
using utility into image). You have this supported via OpenCPN WeatherFax plugin.
It would be nice to completely automate this process using RTL-SDR.
+
See: https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tag/weather-fax/

* Images from NOAA satellites via radio. RTL-SDR can be used to automate this as well.

==== QtVlm

OpenCPN Weather plugins provide weather and weather routing functionality.

There is one more (non-opensource) software solution called 'QtVlm'

https://www.meltemus.com/

which is available for Raspberry Pi.

I've installed and played with it and I have found it it too difficult to use on a small cockpit touchscreen with
default settings, but they can be adjusted. It can also use the charts you would download for OpenCPN.
So it even can be used as your main chart plotter.

Installation:

[source, shell]
----
cd /home/pi
curl https://www.meltemus.com/index.php/en/download/send/9-raspberrypi/209-qtvlm-5-9-8-p1-6 > qtVlm-5.9.8-p1-rpi.tar.gz

==== AvNav

This is a nice chart plotter which runs in a browser supports number of chart formats (You need to convert them though
with the provided utility). Since it is running in Chromium browser, the touchscreen support is better.
This is another option to use as main chart plotter instead of OpenCPN.

===== AvNav Charts

You can use mbtiles which you downloaded for OpenCPN. AvNav needs to convert them first.
To convert:

[source, shell]
----
avnav -g
----

select .mbtiles file, press 'Convert', wait for process to finish.
Next

[source, shell]
----
chromium-browser http://localhost:8099

=== Creating Backup Boot SD Card

Tutorial is here:

http://pysselilivet.blogspot.com/2017/11/rpi-clone-raspberry-boot-disk.html

It is based on rpi-clone software https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone

=== SignalK Applications

==== Freeboard-SK

https://github.com/SignalK/freeboard-sk

Freeboard SK takes charts from SignalK Charts plugin which you install from SignalK app store.
I've configured it to point to .mbtiles chart file for my sailing region.

Login into SignalK (http://localhost:3000) as admin and go to AppStore link (left side) and
install Charts plugin. Then restart the SignalK server from UI and login again as admin.
Go to 'Server' (left side) then 'Plugin Config' / 'Signal K Charts'. Put word 'charts' into
Path field, check 'Active', and proceed with creating symbolic links to your .mbtiles files in
/home/pi/.signalk/charts directory. (See TukTuk Charts installation section in this document).

You can check for charts by accessing this URL:

http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/api/resources/charts

The following plugins should be installed installed on the Signal K node server to enable full functionality:

* freeeboard-sk-helper (Course information)
* sk-resources-fs (Routes, Waypoints, Notes & Regions provider)
* @signalk/charts-plugin (Charts provider)
* signalk-anchoralarm-plugin (anchor alarm settings & notifications)
* signalk-simple-notifications (depth alarm notifications)

It takes some time to download and install them from AppStore via SignalK web UI.

=== Music Player

I've looked at number of media and music player projects available on raspberry pi and the one
which works nice on OpenPlotter and cockpit touch display is Mopidy with Spotify extension
and MusicBox Web UI extension.

Install from apt.mopidy.com

See:
https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/raspberrypi/

https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/debian/#debian-install


For Raspberry PI you should first try installing via apt. If pre-build package
doesn't exists then you use python3 pip.

[source, shell]
----

# Add the archive’s GPG key:
wget -q -O - https://apt.mopidy.com/mopidy.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the APT repo to your package sources:
sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mopidy.list https://apt.mopidy.com/buster.list

sudo adduser mopidy video
sudo adduser mopidy audio
sudo xhost +SI:localuser:mopidy

# Install Mopidy and all dependencies:
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get -y install mopidy mopidy-mpd mopidy-spotify mopidy-tunein

# Install some needed packages
sudo python3 -m pip install mem systems

# Install Mopidy MusicBox Web Client:
sudo python3 -m pip install Mopidy-MusicBox-Webclient

# Install YouTube support
sudo python3 -m pip install --pre Mopidy-YouTube

----

Configure Spotify https://mopidy.com/ext/spotify/

Edit mopidy.conf

=== USB Audio Dongle with audio input/output

Raspberry Pi doesn't have audio input. For it you can use external USB audio dongle card.

Example: Adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/product/1475

Setting up instructions: https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Setting_the_default_device

Find your desired card with:

   cat /proc/asound/cards

and then put into /etc/asound.conf the following:

   defaults.pcm.card 1
   defaults.ctl.card 1

Replace "1" with number of your card determined above.

== Pole for Sailboat Solar Panel / Wind Generator

This is no welding, no bends solution. The pole is built from universal stainless steel marine components.
To reproduce this design you would need only a pipe cutter tool and a drill.
The top is quick release adjustable angle (two axis). Removable for winter storage.
The solar panel is quickly detachable and removable.

Most of the components are common marine rail fittings for 1" tubing. The top one component to make tee join
is aluminum drying or display rack pipe fitting tee connector for 25mm round tube
available from many vendors. It works perfectly. I use an eye nut for quick release instead of a regular nut.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GZTWX85

There is also a closed body turnbuckle in the design. It needs a securing wire to be fixed in place to prevent
unscrewing.

NOTE: I had to add one more turnbuckle to form a stiff triangle to better hold the mast vertically. Two
turnbuckles mounts to the same bolt on the pole and attach to two different points on the vertical stancion.

The pipe cutter which worked perfectly easy for me on stainless steel is this one:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077966G15

The markings say "GT-Q50A" which points to R'DEER tool (Hong Kong brand).

=== Water Tank Restoration

How to Refurbish Water Tanks (By Eian Mathieson)

https://www.cruisingworld.com/how-to-refurbish-water-tanks/

The idea is to cut inspection ports in old aluminum tank. Sand inside. Clear corrosion with white vinegar.
Fix the holes with J-B WaterWeld epoxy putty. Then coat whole inside with Jotun Jotacote 605 (certified for drinking
water tanks). Do it in 3 coats with 24-hour difference. Seal inspection ports with polycarbonate cover plate,
silicone gasket and screw-type deck plate.

The idea is to hang it at night inside the cabin and have a cover for the companionway with a hole for

My boat didn't have any overhead tie points in its cabin. So I installed L-track rail (smooth profile) bolted to existings
overhead bolts.

(LED Power Supply 200W High-powerTransformer Waterproof IP67 12V DC Driver Adapter for Outdoor Use)
and mount it in a place not likely to get wet.
